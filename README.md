# LeetCode-STL-Solutions
Attempting to apply software engineering practices to LeetCode questions

This is me imagining myself solving these problems in daily work instead of in interview setting. This probably would not put me in a good spot for whiteboarding if I'm solving the problems in this way. But that's not the intention of this repo.

The goal is to be explicit in intention, be maintainable, be concise, while still result in decent performance. Hence, a lot of the "smart tricks" (or premature optimizations in 99.9% of the cases) that are usually seen on LeetCode were not in these solutions. I'm trying to leverage C++ STL as much as possible so that I can write less lines of code while still benefit from the code base that has been tested around the industry.
